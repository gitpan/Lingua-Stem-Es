Lingua-Stem-Es version 0.01
===========================

BRIEF EXPLANATION

This module implements Porter's and returns an array reference of stemmed words.
You can define a hash reference keyed by exeption words and whose values will
be returned in the stemmed array reference.

Visit http://snowball.tartarus.org/algorithms/spanish/stemmer.html for the
actual algorithm. That is Mr. Porter's official site. From his site I have 
included the files voc.txt and output.txt, which contain a sample vocabulary 
and the result of applying the stemming algorithm.
These two files are thus used as tests for this implementation.

This module follows the same interface as the Lingua::Stem set of modules
and is heavily based on the work of Sébastien Darribere-Playt, author of
the French implementation.

For more information on the use of the module, see perldoc Lingua::Stem::Es
